  - [x] 2.2 Implement floating window creation with proper sizing and positioning
  - [x] 2.3 Add terminal buffer initialization with `vim.fn.termopen()` integration
  - [x] 2.4 Implement window cleanup and focus management
  - [x] 2.5 Add error handling for terminal creation failures
  - [x] 2.6 Verify all window management tests pass (20/20 tests passing)

- [x] 3. Process Lifecycle and Job Control
  - [x] 3.1 Job creation, monitoring, and completion handling implemented in terminal manager
