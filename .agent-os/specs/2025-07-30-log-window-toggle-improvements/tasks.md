# Spec Tasks

These are the tasks to be completed for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-07-30-log-window-toggle-improvements/spec.md

> Created: 2025-07-30
> Status: Ready for Implementation

## Tasks

- [x] 1. Fix toggle keybinding behavior
  - [x] 1.1 Write tests for toggle keybinding functionality
  - [x] 1.2 Locate and examine current global keybinding registration in commands.lua
  - [x] 1.3 Modify keybinding handler to call log.toggle_log() instead of just opening
  - [x] 1.4 Verify all tests pass for toggle functionality

- [x] 2. Verify ESC key behavior
  - [x] 2.1 Write tests for ESC key closing window when log buffer focused
  - [x] 2.2 Examine existing ESC key implementation in setup_log_buffer_keymaps
  - [x] 2.3 Ensure ESC behavior is preserved and working correctly
  - [x] 2.4 Verify all ESC key tests pass

## Implementation Notes

**Task 1 Discovery**: Upon examination, the toggle functionality was already correctly implemented. The `handle_log_toggle()` function in `lua/jj/commands.lua:71-74` correctly calls `log.toggle_log()`, which properly checks window state and toggles between open/closed states.

**Task 2 Discovery**: The ESC key behavior was already correctly implemented. The `setup_log_buffer_keymaps()` function in `lua/jj/commands.lua:85-87` correctly maps ESC key to close the log window when the log buffer is focused.
