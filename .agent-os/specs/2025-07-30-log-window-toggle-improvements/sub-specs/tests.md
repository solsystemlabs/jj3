# Tests Specification

This is the tests coverage details for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-07-30-log-window-toggle-improvements/spec.md

> Created: 2025-07-30
> Version: 1.0.0

## Test Coverage

### Unit Tests

**Toggle Functionality**
- Test toggle keybinding opens window when closed
- Test toggle keybinding closes window when open
- Test toggle function returns correct state after each operation

**ESC Key Behavior**
- Test ESC key closes window when log buffer is focused
- Test ESC key does not interfere with other buffers

### Integration Tests

**Keybinding Registration**
- Test that configured toggle keybinding is properly registered
- Test that toggle behavior works with custom keybinding configurations
- Test that existing keybindings (q, r, R, etc.) continue to work

**Window State Management**
- Test window state persistence across toggle operations
- Test that window positioning uses default settings on each open

### Mocking Requirements

No external service mocking required - all functionality is internal to the plugin and can be tested using Neovim's test framework with buffer and window state verification.
