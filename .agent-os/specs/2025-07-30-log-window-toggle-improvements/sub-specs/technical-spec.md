# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-07-30-log-window-toggle-improvements/spec.md

> Created: 2025-07-30
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

- Modify the global keybinding handler in `lua/jj/commands.lua` to use `log.toggle_log()` instead of just opening the window
- Ensure the `toggle_log()` function properly checks window state using existing window management functions
- Verify ESC key behavior is maintained in the log buffer through the existing `setup_log_buffer_keymaps()` function
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing configuration options and user customizations

## Approach Options

**Option A:** Modify the existing global keybinding registration
- Pros: Simple change, leverages existing toggle functionality, minimal code changes
- Cons: None identified

**Option B:** Create new toggle-specific keybinding system (Not Selected)
- Pros: More explicit control over toggle behavior
- Cons: Unnecessary complexity, duplicates existing functionality

**Rationale:** Option A is selected because the `toggle_log()` functionality already exists and works correctly. The issue is simply that the global keybinding registration currently calls the wrong function. This is a minimal change that leverages existing, tested functionality.

## External Dependencies

No new external dependencies required. This change uses existing functionality within the jj3 plugin architecture.
