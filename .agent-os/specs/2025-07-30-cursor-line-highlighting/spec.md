> Spec: Cursor Line Highlighting Fix
> Created: 2025-07-30
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Fix the cursor line highlighting in the jj log window to extend across the entire line width instead of only highlighting up to the last character on each line. This will provide better visual feedback for the currently selected line and improve the user experience when navigating through the log.

## User Stories

### Full Line Selection Visual Feedback

As a jj3 plugin user, I want the cursor line highlighting to extend across the entire window width, so that I can clearly see which line is currently selected even when lines have different lengths or contain trailing whitespace.

When navigating through the jj log with j/k keys, the current line should be visually highlighted from the beginning to the end of the window, providing consistent visual feedback regardless of the actual text content length on each line.

## Spec Scope

1. **Full-width cursor line highlighting** - Modify the cursor line highlighting to extend across the entire window width
2. **Consistent visual feedback** - Ensure highlighting works uniformly across all lines regardless of content length
3. **Integration with existing navigation** - Maintain compatibility with current j/k navigation and cursor movement

## Out of Scope

- Changes to cursor highlighting behavior in other buffers or windows outside the jj log
- Modifications to the highlighting color scheme or visual styling beyond the width fix
- Changes to keyboard navigation or movement commands

## Expected Deliverable

1. Cursor line highlighting extends to full window width in the jj log buffer
2. Visual highlighting remains consistent when navigating between lines of different lengths
3. No regression in existing navigation or display functionality
