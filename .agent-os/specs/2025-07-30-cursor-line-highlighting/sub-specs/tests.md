# Tests Specification

This is the tests coverage details for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-07-30-cursor-line-highlighting/spec.md

> Created: 2025-07-30
> Version: 1.0.0

## Test Coverage

### Unit Tests

**UI Module (ui.lua)**
- Test cursor line highlighting is enabled when jj log window is created
- Test cursor line highlighting is properly configured for log buffer
- Test cursor line settings don't affect other buffers when jj log window is closed

**Buffer Management**
- Test cursor line option is set correctly for jj log buffer type
- Test cursor line option is restored when switching away from jj log buffer
- Test proper cleanup when jj log window is destroyed

### Integration Tests

**Window Navigation**
- Test cursor line highlighting remains visible when navigating with j/k keys
- Test highlighting updates correctly when cursor moves to different lines
- Test highlighting works with lines of varying lengths (short, long, empty)
- Test highlighting persists during window resize operations

**Buffer Switching**
- Test cursor line highlighting is isolated to jj log buffer
- Test no impact on cursor line settings in other open buffers
- Test proper restoration of previous cursor line settings when leaving jj log

**Visual Consistency**
- Test highlighting extends to full window width on all line types
- Test highlighting appearance with different color schemes
- Test highlighting behavior with wrapped lines (if applicable)

### Feature Tests

**End-to-End Scenarios**
- Open jj log window and verify full-width cursor line highlighting is present
- Navigate through multiple lines and verify consistent highlighting behavior
- Switch to other buffers and verify no unintended cursor line changes
- Close jj log window and verify proper cleanup of cursor line settings

### Mocking Requirements

- **Terminal Display:** Mock terminal rendering to verify highlighting extends to window edges
- **Window Dimensions:** Mock different window sizes to test highlighting width consistency
- **Color Schemes:** Test with multiple Neovim color schemes to ensure compatibility
