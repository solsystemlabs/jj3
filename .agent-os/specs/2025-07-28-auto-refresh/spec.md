> Spec: Auto-refresh and Smart Caching for jj Log Display
> Created: 2025-07-28
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement intelligent auto-refresh functionality with smart caching to eliminate performance bottlenecks when displaying jj logs in large repositories. The system will automatically refresh the log display when jj commands are executed through the plugin, cache parsed commit data to avoid expensive re-parsing, and provide manual refresh controls for user convenience.

## User Stories

### Performance Optimization

As a jujutsu user working in a large repository, I want the log window to open instantly without waiting for expensive parsing operations every time, so that I can efficiently navigate my commit history without performance interruptions.

The plugin should cache parsed commit data and intelligently merge current working copy changes to provide near-instantaneous log display.

### Command-Triggered Refresh

As a user executing jj operations through the plugin, I want the log display to automatically update to reflect my changes, so that I always see the current state of my repository without manual intervention.

When I run commands like `jj new`, `jj rebase`, or `jj abandon` through the plugin, the log should refresh to show the new repository state.

### Manual Refresh Control

As a user, I want to manually refresh the log display when needed, so that I can update the view if external changes occur or if I want to force a fresh parse of the repository state.

A simple 'R' keybinding should trigger a complete refresh of the log display.

## Spec Scope

### Phase 1: Command-Triggered Refresh (1 week)
1. **Manual Refresh Keybinding** - 'R' key to trigger complete log refresh
2. **Auto-refresh on Plugin Commands** - Automatically refresh after jj commands executed through plugin
3. **Command Queuing** - Queue new commands during active refresh operations to prevent race conditions
4. **Refresh State Management** - Track refresh operations and provide user feedback

### Phase 2: Smart Caching System (1 week, separate commit)
1. **In-Memory Cache** - Cache parsed commit objects to avoid expensive re-parsing
2. **Current Commit Optimization** - Use `jj log -T <template> -r @` to quickly check current commit state
3. **Cache Invalidation** - Update cache when plugin commands modify repository state
4. **Window Open Optimization** - Merge current commit data with cache for instant display

### Phase 3: Background Optimizations (if needed)
1. **Async Refresh Operations** - Non-blocking refresh for better user experience
2. **Progressive Loading** - Handle very large repositories with incremental loading

## Out of Scope

- External jj command detection (filesystem watching)
- Persistent disk caching
- Cross-session cache persistence
- Real-time collaboration features
- Advanced conflict resolution during refresh

## Expected Deliverable

### Phase 1 Deliverables
1. 'R' keybinding triggers complete manual refresh of log display
2. All jj commands executed through plugin automatically trigger log refresh
3. Commands are queued and blocked during active refresh operations
4. Users receive clear feedback about refresh state and queued operations

### Phase 2 Deliverables  
1. Log window opens instantly using cached data merged with current commit state
2. Cache is maintained in-memory and updated only when plugin commands execute
3. Performance improvement of >80% for repeated log window opening in large repositories
4. Navigation system continues to work seamlessly with cached data

## Technical Requirements

### Performance Targets
- **Window open time**: <200ms for cached data in large repositories (>1000 commits)
- **Cache hit rate**: >90% for typical workflow sessions
- **Memory usage**: Cache should not exceed 50MB for repositories with 10,000+ commits

### Integration Points
- **Navigation System**: Must work seamlessly with cached commit data
- **Command Framework**: Integration with existing jj command execution
- **Window Management**: Cache lifecycle tied to window open/close events
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback to full refresh if cache is corrupted

### Separation of Concerns
- **Refresh Logic**: Core refresh functionality (Phase 1)
- **Caching Layer**: Smart caching implementation (Phase 2, separate commit for easy backout)
- **Background Processing**: Async optimizations (Phase 3)
