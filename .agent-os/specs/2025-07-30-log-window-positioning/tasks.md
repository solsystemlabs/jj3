# Spec Tasks

These are the tasks to be completed for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-07-30-log-window-positioning/spec.md

> Created: 2025-07-30
> Status: Ready for Implementation

## Tasks

- [ ] 1. Implement configuration system for window positioning
  - [ ] 1.1 Write tests for configuration option handling
  - [ ] 1.2 Add window_type configuration option to config.lua with default "floating"
  - [ ] 1.3 Add validation for configuration values ("floating" or "split")
  - [ ] 1.4 Verify all configuration tests pass

- [ ] 2. Implement floating window positioning logic  
  - [ ] 2.1 Write tests for floating window positioning calculations
  - [ ] 2.2 Create function to calculate floating window position relative to entire Neovim interface
  - [ ] 2.3 Implement floating window creation with global positioning using vim.api.nvim_open_win()
  - [ ] 2.4 Handle edge cases where calculated position exceeds screen bounds
  - [ ] 2.5 Verify all floating window positioning tests pass

- [ ] 3. Implement vertical split positioning logic
  - [ ] 3.1 Write tests for vertical split positioning
  - [ ] 3.2 Create function to open vertical split at far right of Neovim interface
  - [ ] 3.3 Implement split window creation logic that works with existing window layouts
  - [ ] 3.4 Handle edge cases with complex split configurations
  - [ ] 3.5 Verify all split positioning tests pass

- [ ] 4. Update window management system to use configuration
  - [ ] 4.1 Write integration tests for window type selection
  - [ ] 4.2 Modify ui.lua to check configuration and route to appropriate positioning logic
  - [ ] 4.3 Ensure consistent behavior regardless of current window focus
  - [ ] 4.4 Test window positioning with various existing window layouts
  - [ ] 4.5 Verify all integration tests pass

- [ ] 5. Validate and document the implementation
  - [ ] 5.1 Run full test suite to ensure no regressions
  - [ ] 5.2 Test both floating and split modes manually with different window configurations
  - [ ] 5.3 Verify default floating behavior works without configuration
  - [ ] 5.4 Update any relevant documentation or comments
  - [ ] 5.5 Verify all tests pass and implementation meets spec requirements
