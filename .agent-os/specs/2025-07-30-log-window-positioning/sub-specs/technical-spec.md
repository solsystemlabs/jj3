# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-07-30-log-window-positioning/spec.md

> Created: 2025-07-30
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

- Modify window creation logic to calculate position relative to Neovim's full interface dimensions
- Use `vim.o.columns` to determine the rightmost position instead of current window positioning
- Implement configuration option for window type selection (floating vs split)
- Default to floating window mode when no configuration is specified
- Handle edge cases where the calculated position might exceed available screen space
- Maintain existing window size and content display behavior
- Ensure both floating and split positioning work correctly with various window layouts

## Approach Options

**Option A: Floating Window with Global Positioning** (Default)
- Pros: Clean separation from existing splits, precise control over positioning, doesn't affect existing window layout
- Cons: May not integrate as seamlessly with existing window management workflows

**Option B: Vertical Split at Far Right** (Configurable)
- Pros: Better integration with Neovim's native window system, works well with existing split workflows
- Cons: More complex to implement consistently across different window configurations, affects existing layout

**Selected Approach: Dual Implementation**
Both options will be implemented with floating window as the default behavior.

**Rationale:** Providing both options gives users flexibility to choose the behavior that best fits their workflow while defaulting to floating windows which provide cleaner separation and don't disrupt existing window layouts.

## External Dependencies

- **No new dependencies required** - Implementation uses existing Neovim API functions
- **vim.api.nvim_open_win()** - For floating window creation and positioning
- **vim.cmd('vsplit')** - For vertical split window creation
- **vim.o.columns** - For determining total Neovim width
- **vim.api.nvim_list_wins()** - For analyzing current window layout
- **Configuration system** - For storing and retrieving user window type preference
