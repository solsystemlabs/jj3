# Tests Specification

This is the tests coverage details for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-07-24-plugin-initialization/spec.md

> Created: 2025-07-24
> Version: 1.0.0

## Test Coverage

### Unit Tests

**lua/jj/init.lua**
- Plugin initialization without errors
- Module loading and setup completion
- Configuration defaults are established

**lua/jj/commands.lua**
- `:JJ` command registration and basic functionality
- Command availability after plugin load
- Command execution without runtime errors

**lua/jj/config.lua**
- Default configuration loading
- Configuration validation (basic structure)

### Integration Tests

**Plugin Loading**
- Plugin loads successfully through lazy.nvim
- Plugin loads successfully through traditional managers (packer, vim-plug)
- No conflicts with other plugins during loading

**Command and Keybinding Integration**
- `:JJ` command is available after plugin initialization
- `<leader>jl` keybinding is registered and responds
- Commands work in different buffer contexts

### Feature Tests

**Basic Functionality**
- User can install plugin and run `:JJ` without errors
- User can press `<leader>jl` without errors
- Plugin provides appropriate feedback when commands are executed

### Mocking Requirements

- **File System**: Mock jj repository detection for consistent testing
- **Neovim APIs**: Mock vim.api calls for command and keymap registration during testing
- **Plugin Manager Context**: Test both lazy-loaded and immediate-load scenarios
