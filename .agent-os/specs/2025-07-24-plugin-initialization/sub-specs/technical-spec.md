# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-07-24-plugin-initialization/spec.md

> Created: 2025-07-24
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

- **Plugin Structure**: Follow standard Neovim plugin conventions with `plugin/` for initialization and `lua/` for modules
- **Lazy Loading**: Support lazy.nvim's lazy loading patterns with proper event triggers and command registration
- **Module Architecture**: Implement clean separation between initialization, configuration, and core functionality
- **Neovim API Usage**: Use modern Neovim 0.11+ APIs for command registration and keybinding setup
- **Error Handling**: Basic validation that we're in a valid jj repository context

## Approach Options

**Option A:** Traditional plugin structure with immediate loading
- Pros: Simple, works with all plugin managers, immediate availability
- Cons: Slower startup time, loads even when not needed

**Option B:** Lazy loading with event-driven initialization (Selected)
- Pros: Better performance, loads only when needed, modern best practice
- Cons: Slightly more complex setup, requires careful event handling

**Rationale:** Lazy loading is the modern standard and aligns with our performance goals. Users expect plugins to load efficiently.

## External Dependencies

- **No external Lua libraries** - Using only Neovim built-in APIs
- **jujutsu (jj)** - Required in PATH, but validation deferred to actual functionality
- **Neovim 0.11+** - For modern API compatibility

## File Structure

```
plugin/
└── jj.vim                # Traditional vim initialization (minimal)

lua/
└── jj/
    ├── init.lua          # Main plugin entry point
    ├── config.lua        # Configuration management
    └── commands.lua      # Command registration and handling
```

## Initialization Flow

1. Plugin manager loads `plugin/jj.vim` or triggers lazy loading
2. `lua/jj/init.lua` is called to set up the plugin
3. Commands and keybindings are registered
4. Plugin is ready for use

## Command and Keybinding Specifications

- **User Command**: `:JJ` - Main plugin interface (placeholder functionality)
- **Global Keybinding**: `<leader>jl` - Toggle log window (placeholder functionality)
- **Event Triggers**: For lazy loading - on `:JJ` command or `<leader>jl` keypress
