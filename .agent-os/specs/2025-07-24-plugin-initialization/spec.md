# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Plugin Initialization and Setup
> Created: 2025-07-24
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Establish the foundational plugin structure and initialization system for jj.nvim, providing proper Neovim integration with lazy loading support and a single global keybinding to toggle the log window.

## User Stories

### Basic Plugin Setup

As a Neovim user with jujutsu, I want to install jj.nvim and have it initialize properly, so that I can begin using the plugin without configuration errors or conflicts.

The plugin should load cleanly through standard plugin managers (lazy.nvim, packer.nvim, vim-plug), establish the core module structure, and register the `:JJ` user command and `<leader>jl` keybinding for toggling the log window.

## Spec Scope

1. **Plugin Directory Structure** - Create the standard Neovim plugin layout with lua/ directory and proper module organization
2. **Lazy Loading Support** - Configure plugin to load on-demand through lazy.nvim and other plugin managers
3. **Core Module System** - Establish the main entry point and module loading architecture
4. **User Command Registration** - Register the `:JJ` command for plugin interaction
5. **Global Keybinding Setup** - Register `<leader>jl` to toggle the log window

## Out of Scope

- Log parsing and display functionality
- Window management beyond basic toggle
- Command execution framework
- Configuration system beyond basic setup
- Error handling for jj command availability

## Expected Deliverable

1. A properly structured Neovim plugin that loads without errors through plugin managers
2. `:JJ` command is available and responds (even if just with a placeholder message)
3. `<leader>jl` keybinding is registered and functional (even if just with a placeholder action)
