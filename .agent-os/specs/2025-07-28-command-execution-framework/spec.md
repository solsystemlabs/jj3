# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Extensible Command Execution Framework

> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement a flexible and extensible system for executing jujutsu (jj) operations directly from the plugin interface with user-customizable commands and keybindings. This framework will allow users to execute common jj operations without leaving Neovim while providing the flexibility to customize commands, arguments, and keybindings to match their specific workflows.

## User Stories

### Streamlined jj Operations

As a jujutsu user working within Neovim, I want to execute common jj commands (new, rebase, squash, edit, abandon) directly from the log display, so that I can maintain my workflow without switching to the terminal.

The plugin should provide sensible default keybindings for common operations while allowing me to execute any jj command with the appropriate commit/change IDs automatically passed as context.

### Customizable Command Framework

As a power user with specific workflow preferences, I want to customize the available commands and their keybindings to match my preferred jj flag combinations and operation patterns, so that the plugin adapts to my workflow rather than forcing me to adapt to the plugin.

I should be able to define custom commands with specific flag combinations, override default keybindings, and add new operations that aren't included in the defaults.

### Context-Aware Operations

As a user navigating the jj log, I want commands to automatically use the commit/change ID of the currently selected line, so that I don't have to manually copy and paste IDs or remember complex command syntax.

When I press a keybinding, the plugin should intelligently determine the appropriate commit or change ID from my cursor position and pass it to the jj command automatically.

### Advanced Command Options

As a user who needs access to the full range of jj command options, I want an intuitive menu system that lets me access advanced flags and options for each command, so that I can perform complex operations without memorizing command-line syntax.

I should be able to press an uppercase key to open a menu for advanced options, while lowercase keys provide quick access to common operations. The menu should be customizable so I can add my own frequently-used flag combinations.

## Spec Scope

1. **Generic Command Execution Engine** - Core system that can execute any jj command with proper argument substitution and error handling
2. **Dual-Level Command Interface** - Quick actions (lowercase keys) for common operations and advanced menus (uppercase keys) for full option access
3. **Interactive Menu Architecture** - Customizable menu system for accessing command options, flags, and advanced workflows
4. **Default Command Set** - Pre-configured keybindings and menus for common operations (new, rebase, squash, edit, abandon)
5. **Menu Customization System** - Framework allowing users to define custom menu options and override existing defaults
6. **Keybinding Registration System** - Framework allowing users to register custom keymaps for any jj operation in their configuration
7. **Context-Aware Parameter Passing** - Automatic detection and substitution of commit/change IDs from cursor position
8. **Operation Feedback System** - Clear success/error messages and command output display for all executed operations

## Out of Scope

- Real-time command suggestions or auto-completion
- Multi-step command workflows or macros
- Integration with external git operations
- Persistent command history across sessions
- Advanced conflict resolution interfaces
- Command scheduling or delayed execution
- Complex form-based input interfaces (beyond simple menus)
- Integration with external menu systems or fuzzy finders

## Expected Deliverable

1. Users can execute quick jj operations using lowercase keybindings (n, r, a, e, s) from the log display
2. Users can access advanced command options using uppercase keybindings (N, R, A, E, S) that open contextual menus
3. All executed commands automatically receive appropriate commit/change IDs based on cursor position
4. Menu system provides intuitive access to common flag combinations and advanced options for each command
5. Users can customize menu options and add their own flag combinations through plugin configuration
6. Clear feedback is provided for all command execution results (success, error, output)
7. Command framework integrates seamlessly with existing log display and navigation functionality
