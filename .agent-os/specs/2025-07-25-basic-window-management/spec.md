## Overview

Implement a window management system that creates and manages dedicated Neovim windows (floating or split) for displaying the jj log graph interface. This foundation enables users to view the parsed jj log output in a proper UI container that integrates seamlessly with their existing Neovim workflow.

## User Stories

### Developer Viewing jj Log

As a Neovim user working with jujutsu, I want to open a dedicated window showing my jj log graph, so that I can visualize my repository state without leaving my editor or switching to the terminal.

The user executes a command (like `:JJ` or a keybinding) and a window appears showing their jj log in an interactive format. The window should feel native to Neovim with proper sizing, positioning, and integration with existing editor layout.

### Developer Customizing Window Layout

As a power user, I want to configure how and where the jj log window appears, so that it fits my preferred workflow and screen setup.

The user can configure whether the window appears as a floating window, vertical split, horizontal split, and control aspects like size, position, and border style through plugin configuration.

## Spec Scope

1. **Window Creation API** - Core functions to create floating windows and splits with proper buffer management
2. **Window Configuration System** - User-configurable options for window type, size, position, and appearance
3. **Buffer Management** - Proper setup of dedicated buffers for jj log display with appropriate buffer options
4. **Window Lifecycle Management** - Functions to open, close, toggle, and manage window state
5. **Layout Integration** - Ensure windows work well with existing Neovim layout and don't disrupt user workflow

## Out of Scope

- Window content rendering (jj log display) - handled by existing log parsing module
- Keybindings within the window - will be addressed in buffer navigation feature
- Auto-refresh functionality - separate feature for filesystem change detection
- Multiple simultaneous windows - single window focus for MVP

## Expected Deliverable

1. Users can execute a command that opens a properly configured window displaying jj log content
2. Window appearance and behavior can be customized through plugin configuration options
3. Window can be cleanly opened, closed, and toggled without affecting other Neovim windows or layout
