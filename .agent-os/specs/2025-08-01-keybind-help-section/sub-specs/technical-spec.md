# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-01-keybind-help-section/spec.md

> Created: 2025-08-01
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

- **Help Section Rendering**: Create a dedicated area at bottom of log window buffer for keybind display
- **Buffer Management**: Dynamically resize log content area when help section is visible/hidden
- **Merged Keybind Access**: Use existing merged keybind data (not default_commands directly) for help content
- **Text Formatting**: Format keybinds as "key: description" with proper alignment and spacing
- **Configuration Integration**: Access the already-merged keybind configuration that the plugin uses
- **Toggle State Persistence**: Remember help section visibility preference across plugin sessions
- **Performance**: Minimal impact on log rendering performance, lazy-load help content

## Approach Options

**Option A: Separate Buffer for Help Section**
- Pros: Clean separation, easier window management, independent scrolling
- Cons: More complex window coordination, potential focus issues

**Option B: Integrated Buffer with Separator** (Selected)
- Pros: Single buffer management, simpler implementation, consistent navigation
- Cons: Need to handle content separation, scrolling limitations

**Option C: Floating Window Overlay**
- Pros: Non-intrusive, flexible positioning, easy to toggle
- Cons: May obscure log content, complex positioning logic

**Rationale:** Option B provides the best balance of simplicity and user experience. Using a single buffer with a visual separator (like a horizontal line) keeps the implementation straightforward while maintaining the integrated feel users expect from vim-style interfaces.

## External Dependencies

- **Existing keybind system** - Leverage current configuration and registration mechanisms
- **Justification:** No new external dependencies required, builds on existing plugin architecture
