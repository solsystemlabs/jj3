## 2025-07-24: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Team

### Decision

Create jj3, a Neovim plugin that provides an interactive jj log graph interface with extensible command system for jujutsu version control operations, targeting Neovim and jj users who want to streamline their version control workflow without leaving their editor.

### Context

Developers using jujutsu (jj) with Neovim face constant context switching between editor and terminal for version control operations. Existing solutions either require external tools or don't provide the visual feedback and workflow integration that jj users need. The jj ecosystem lacks native editor integrations, creating an opportunity for a focused, extensible solution.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **External GUI Tool**
   - Pros: Rich UI capabilities, standalone operation, cross-editor compatibility
   - Cons: Context switching, separate learning curve, not integrated with Neovim workflow

2. **Git-focused Plugin Adaptation**
   - Pros: Existing codebase, proven UI patterns, established user base
   - Cons: jj concepts don't map cleanly to git, would require significant modifications, suboptimal UX

3. **Terminal-based TUI Tool**
   - Pros: No editor integration complexity, could work with any editor
   - Cons: Still requires context switching, doesn't leverage Neovim's plugin capabilities

### Rationale

Choosing a native Neovim plugin provides the best user experience by eliminating context switching and leveraging Neovim's powerful plugin architecture. The extensible command system addresses the key insight that jj workflows are highly personal and varied - rather than trying to support every possible command combination, we provide a framework for users to customize their own workflows.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Zero context switching for jj operations within Neovim
- Leverages existing Neovim keybinding and UI patterns users already know
- Extensible architecture allows for community contributions and personal customization
- First-class jj support rather than git-focused design adapted for jj

**Negative:**
- Limited to Neovim users only, excluding other editor users
- Requires users to learn plugin-specific configuration for custom commands
- Dependency on both Neovim and jj availability in PATH
- Initial learning curve for users unfamiliar with Neovim plugin customization

## 2025-07-24: Hardcoded Defaults with User Override Architecture

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Implement a command system with sensible hardcoded defaults for common jj operations that can be overridden and extended by users through configuration. The plugin ships with a working set of menu options and keybindings that users can customize to match their preferred workflows.

### Context

jj has a rich command-line interface with many commands and flags. Different users have different preferences for flag combinations, workflow patterns, and command usage. A purely extensible system would be too complex for new users, while a purely hardcoded system would be too limiting for experienced users.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Purely Hardcoded Command Set**
   - Pros: Simpler implementation, predictable behavior, works out of the box
   - Cons: Limited flexibility, requires plugin updates for new workflows, doesn't match all user preferences

2. **Purely Extensible Framework**
   - Pros: Complete flexibility, future-proof, supports any workflow
   - Cons: Overwhelming for new users, requires significant configuration before being useful

3. **Dynamic Command Discovery**
   - Pros: Automatically supports all jj commands, no hardcoded limitations
   - Cons: Complex implementation, harder to provide good UX, difficult to handle context-specific operations

### Rationale

The hybrid approach provides immediate value for new users while maintaining flexibility for advanced customization. Users can start using the plugin immediately with sensible defaults, then gradually customize it to match their specific workflows. This also allows the plugin to serve as documentation for common jj operations.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Works out of the box for common jj workflows
- Users can start simple and gradually add complexity
- Hardcoded defaults serve as examples for custom configurations
- Plugin remains useful as jj evolves through user customization
- Balances discoverability with flexibility

**Negative:**
- More complex implementation requiring both hardcoded and configurable systems
- Documentation must cover both default usage and customization
- Potential for confusion between default and custom behaviors
- Need to maintain sensible defaults as jj evolves
